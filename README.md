# Zont API

This module provides an interface to communicate with [ZONT API](https://zont-online.ru/api/docs/)
for monitoring and controlling various supported devices.

It was initially designed and written for gathering a number of key metrics from
[BAXI Connect+](https://baxi.ru/production/sistemy_udalennogo_upravleniya_kotlom/baxi_connect_plus/)
controller made by [MicroLine LLC](https://zont.online/product/kontroller-baxi-connect/),
but should work with other compatible devices as well.
